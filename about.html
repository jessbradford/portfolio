      <p>
        I currently live in the San Francisco Bay area but am originally from Utah. My husband, daughter and I moved
        here last year. When I was a child my family wasn’t very well off, and this forced me to be creative. When I was
        little my mom used to create meals fit for kings based off a few small ingredients. She would create something
        amazing from nothing. I learned this creativity from her. I loved coming up with something unique from little to
        no “ingredients”. I applied this thought process to everything. Especially when it came to design work.
        <br>
        In college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I took a web design class, and I loved it. But at the time, I
        didn’t pursue it because I didn’t think I was smart enough. Which thinking back, that was insane. My job at the
        time put me in financials. I worked in financials for several years. And when I first started I thought that’s
        what I liked, but what I liked was finding creative solutions for clients. When I would solve the client's
        problems, then I would get bored and move on to a new position. This went on for several years until I started
        my own business doing bookkeeping for a few small businesses. While I was moving through different companies, my
        husband became a software engineer. He started including me in his projects, and it sparked my creativity. I
        loved helping him with these projects and helping him design applications.
        <br>
        One of the first projects my husband had me help him with was an open source content management system. I had
        very little training at this point. I had taught myself how to code but design was much harder since I didn’t
        have anyone I could go to for advice or questions. As I started studying design further, I knew this was what I
        wanted to do. I wanted to change my career to a product designer. Design is where I can express myself, and I
        love where it takes me. I don’t know where my path will go, but I am looking forward to different and new
        projects. Where I can explore my creativity and I hope that I can contribute to projects that help everyone.
