        <h5>SUMMARY</h5>
        <p class="auto desktop-word">
          Many writers are faced with the problem of the same people reviewing and editing. Collab gives writers the
          opportunity to collaborate with other writers and editors and also acts as a blog spot to post their work.

      <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
      <p class="auto desktop-word">Users are in need of a place that they can collaborate with others, create, save
        and organize content.</p>
      <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
      <p class="auto desktop-word">
        An application that focuses on a niche market in the writing world. This application allows users to create new
        content, and receive feedback from others to help improve their writings while also allowing a space for writers
        to post their work for readers.

            use tags. <br><br><span class="bold">50%</span> of bloggers are in need of editors. <br><br>At this point in
            the process I wasn’t completely sure where I was heading with this project. It was difficult
            for me to form a survey when I wasn’t sure what I was looking for. I knew I wanted to create something for
            writers, and what I found from the survey is there were many bloggers who required assistance from editors.
            I
            decided to design an application that is a combination of Google Drive, Pinterest, and Medium.</p>

          After I created wireframes on paper, I created low fidelity wireframes in Figma and created a clickable prototype. I realized that I
          was missing a few screens such as the confirmation messages. After I had added what I thought was needed I tested three users. I asked
          all three users to do certain tasks. These tasks were logging in, creating a post, reading a post, organizing content, and to comment on the posts. The
          users didn't have trouble logging in, creating or reading. But commenting and organizing was a struggle. After users created their posts
          they struggled with being able to go back to find their posts.

        Taking what I learned from my user testing on the low-fidelity mockups I created the high fidelity wireframes with the branding.
        I had a problem that was similar to the first round of testing. The site was fairly easy to navigate for users and they had no trouble
        signing up, creating, editing and reading the content. The problem that I faced again though were users were confused
        about what the site was for and why they would want to use this. I was able to take this information and
        eventually ended with a “How it Works” section to clearly label what users were confused about.

        The start of the project was rough. Because I wasn’t sure what I was making and this led to me not feeling
        confident about the direction of the project. I didn’t begin to have a feel for what I was creating until I
        started creating the wireframes. This is when I began to have a visual and focused path for the project. As soon
        as I knew the direction I needed to take, the project was smooth sailing. If I had more time I would have liked
        to do more testing on the high-fi prototype. I would also like to continue working on the visual aspects. Visual
        is not a strong point of mine, and I know it could use some work. I would also like to work on the branding
        more; specifically the logo. I’m not completely happy with how it turned out, and I would even consider going
        with a completely different logo. Sketching out the different logo ideas is what helped me come up with what I
        have, and I would have liked to continue working through that thought process given more time.
