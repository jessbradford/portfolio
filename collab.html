        <h5>SUMMARY</h5>
        <p class="desktop-text-center">
          Many writers are faced with the problem of the same people reviewing and editing. Collab gives writers the
          opportunity to collaborate with other writers and editors and also acts as a blog spot to post their work.
        </p>

      <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
      <p class="desktop-text-center">Users are in need of a place that they can collaborate with others, create, save
        and organize content.</p>
      <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
      <p class="desktop-text-center">
        An application that focuses on a niche market in the writing world. This application allows users to create new
        content, and receive feedback from others to help improve their writings while also allowing a space for writers
        to post their work for readers.

            use tags. <br><br><span class="bold">50%</span> of bloggers are in need of editors. <br><br>At this point in
            the process I wasn’t completely sure where I was heading with this project. It was difficult
            for me to form a survey when I wasn’t sure what I was looking for. I knew I wanted to create something for
            writers, and what I found from the survey is there were many bloggers who required assistance from editors.
            I
            decided to design an application that is a combination of Google Drive, Pinterest, and Medium.</p>

        I performed testing on the low fidelity wireframes, and then again on the high fidelity wireframes. Both sets
        of tests I received similar results. The site was fairly easy to navigate for users and they had no trouble
        signing up, creating, editing and reading the content. The problem that I faced though were users were confused
        about what the site was for and why they would want to use this. I was able to take this information and
        eventually ended with a “How it Works” section to clearly label what users were confused about.

      <h5 class="content desktop-content tablet-content">CONCLUSION</h5>
      <p class="content desktop-content tablet-content">
        The start of the project was rough. Because I wasn’t sure what I was making and this led to me not feeling
        confident about the direction of the project. I didn’t begin to have a feel for what I was creating until I
        started creating the wireframes. This is when I began to have a visual and focused path for the project. As soon
        as I knew the direction I needed to take, the project was smooth sailing. If I had more time I would have liked
        to do more testing on the high-fi prototype. I would also like to continue working on the visual aspects. Visual
        is not a strong point of mine, and I know it could use some work. I would also like to work on the branding
        more; specifically the logo. I’m not completely happy with how it turned out, and I would even consider going
        with a completely different logo. Sketching out the different logo ideas is what helped me come up with what I
        have, and I would have liked to continue working through that thought process given more time.
