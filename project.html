      <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
      <p>
        Many writers are faced with the problem of the same people reviewing and editing. Collab gives writers the
        opportunity to collaborate with other writers and editors and also acts as a blog spot to post their work.
      </p>
      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>UX Design | Visual Design | Brand & Identity</p>

      <h4>PROBLEM</h4>
      <p>Users are in need of a place that they can collaborate with others, create, save and organize content.</p>
      <h4>SOLUTION</h4>
      <p>
        An application that focuses on a niche market in the writing world. This application allows users to create new
        content, and receive feedback from others to help improve their writings while also allowing a space for writers
        to post their work for readers.

      <h4>SURVEY RESULTS</h4>
      <p><b>70%</b> of users are interested in written content over videos, pictures, audio, etc.</p>
      <p><b>70%</b> of bloggers use categories to organize and <b>60%</b> use tags.</p>
      <p><b>50%</b> of bloggers are in need of editors.</p>
      <p>
        At this point in the process I wasn’t completely sure where I was heading with this project. It was difficult
        for me to form a survey when I wasn’t sure what I was looking for. I knew I wanted to create something for
        writers, and what I found from the survey is there were many bloggers who required assistance from editors. I
        decided to design an application that is a combination of Google Drive, Pinterest, and Medium.

      <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
      <img src="assets/collab/512px-Google_Drive_logo.png" alt="Google Drive logo" width="161" height="161" />
      <h6>GOOGLE DRIVE</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>No niche market</li>
        <li>Easy to navigate</li>
        <li>Monopoly on the market</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="assets/collab/badgeRGB-288px.png" alt="Pinterest logo" width="140" height="140" />
      <h6>PINTEREST</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>They own the market on visual bookmarking</li>
        <li>Room for competition</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Focusing on the best features of these sites I was able to create Collab. The features I focused on were:
        Pinterest’s visual organization, Google’s easy navigation, a visually appealing site, and a wide variety of
        features while targeting a more specific market as BookType does.

      <h4>PERSONAS</h4>
      <p>
        Based on the survey and the problems that we are wanting to solve I created three different personas: an author,
        editor, and reader.

      <h4>USER FLOWS</h4>
      <p>
        Based on the information I gathered for my user stories I created user flows for how users will interact with
        the product and accomplish the goals.

      <p>
        I was able to use the user flows to create wireframes on paper, and then create low fidelity wireframes in
        Figma.

      <img src="assets/collab/Colored.png" alt="collab final colored logo" width="232" height="284.5" />
      <p>
        I drew out a mind map to help work through my thought process, and decided on using a dolphin for the logo
        because they are a collaborative, social animal.
      </p>
      <h6>STYLING</h6>
      <p>
        I wanted the site to be intuitive and easy to understand. The colors that I chose are green and blue to help
        represent wisdom, stability, nurturing, growth and change. I chose the Roboto font because it was modern and
        easy to read.

      <p>
        I performed testing on the low fidelity wireframes, and then again on the high fidelity wireframes. Both sets
        of tests I received similar results. The site was fairly easy to navigate for users and they had no trouble
        signing up, creating, editing and reading the content. The problem that I faced though were users were confused
        about what the site was for and why they would want to use this. I was able to take this information and
        eventually ended with a “How it Works” section to clearly label what users were confused about.

      <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
      <p>
        The start of the project was rough. Because I wasn’t sure what I was making and this led to me not feeling
        confident about the direction of the project. I didn’t begin to have a feel for what I was creating until I
        started creating the wireframes. This is when I began to have a visual and focused path for the project. As soon
        as I knew the direction I needed to take, the project was smooth sailing. If I had more time I would have liked
        to do more testing on the high-fi prototype. I would also like to continue working on the visual aspects. Visual
        is not a strong point of mine, and I know it could use some work. I would also like to work on the branding
        more; specifically the logo. I’m not completely happy with how it turned out, and I would even consider going
        with a completely different logo. Sketching out the different logo ideas is what helped me come up with what I
        have, and I would have liked to continue working through that thought process given more time.
